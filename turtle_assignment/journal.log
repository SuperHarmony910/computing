Objective: created a chequered board to play checkers on.

-	A function was made to facilitate the creation of squares.

-	A global variable, `c`, was created for the colour alteration between the squares uniform with the
	aforementioned function.
	
-	A while loop was used to create the checker board. 
		For aesthetic pleasure, the checker board animation will be spiralling into the top left corner instead
		of a more conventional vertical/horizontal setup
		
-	Another while loop was employed to create the checker pieces on the board, using a self-devised principle
	whereby when the rows and columns of the board are sorted from 0 to 7, the sum of the coordinates is
	always odd - therefore the modulus of the sum will never be 0. This was used to place the checker pieces
	acordingly.
		I discovered this principle when I was listing out the pairs of numbers in an x-y relationship,
		attempting to determine a correlation between every pair of coordinates that contained a checker piece.
		General ability skills come in handy sometimes :)
